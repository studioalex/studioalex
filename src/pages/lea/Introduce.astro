    My UX/UI is based on  realization of your ideas. I'm ready to undertake
    all the work beginning from the analysis stage up to support of the
    released project. I will create wireframes, prototypes and Fine Fidelity
    Interfaces, coordinate stakeholder and user with expertsknowlege and
    provide the right solutions for your ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can help your team with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>project scoping</strong>: figure out and prioritize the core features of your application based
    on what your users actually need
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>user experience design/research</strong>: work with you to design interactions that are easy to use 
    and intuitive for your users
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>data visualizations</strong>: tell a story through your data, in a way that is 
    easy to understand, self explanatory and interesting
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>debugging your team</strong>: help you figure out why your team might be stuck and have trouble
    focusing on features or delivering them
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>engineering</strong>: answer technical questions about web best practices (eg. the performance and accessibility 
    of your product), do code reviews, or offer feedback and suggestions for improvement
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>mentorship, guidance &amp; leadership</strong>: I can help you brainstorm creative ideas, offer feedback on your
    written materials and presentations, and help you craft your key messaging.

    I am often asked about the specifics of some piece of software or hardware I use,
    so <a href="/lea/uses">this page</a> will serve as a living document and a place to point curious designers and developers
    to when I get asked.
