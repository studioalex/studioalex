# Welcome to [StudioAlex](https://www.studioalex.dev/)

This is the code base for our web presence, built using [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). [Astro](https://astro.build) was the perfect choice for us because it offers a simpler approach than other frameworks like 11ty or Hugo. [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) allows us to easily manage our content without relying on a database or third-party service. We're always open to suggestions for improving our setup.

## Why we chose Astro and Netlify CMS

Astro is a lightweight framework that allows us to create a simple and fast website. Netlify CMS is an intuitive and easily configurable content management system that creates content as Markdown files, which are stored in the project repository. This allows us to easily make adjustments to our content without needing a separate database or third-party service.

## Features of our template

Our template includes the following features:

- Startpage with hero, project/showcases, and technology overview sections
- Blog service with proper meta information for each post
- Personal page
- Page about personal hardware and applications used
- Dark and light mode
- Easy configuration via JSON data files
