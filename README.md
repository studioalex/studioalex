# Welcome to [StudioAlex](https://www.studioalex.dev/)

This is the code base for our web presence based on [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Contentful](https://www.contenful.com). While Astro is one of the best decisions we've made, Contentful is still in the testing phase. We are always open to suggestions.
You are also welcome to use this project as a basis for your presentation.

## ðŸš€ Why

We wanted to have a simpler approach to our web presence than current frameworks such as 11ty or Hugo have. Astro JS offers exactly that. In the second step we separate the content to facilitate adjustments. These should also be easily adaptable by everyone in the team. With Contentful, we have achieved this. As soon as new content is published in Contentful, the application is rebuilt via a webhook. On our website we describe how such a webhook is set up in Contetnful.
